How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It cleared that when working with code, human error is likely,
    and it sometimes hard be spotted with the naked eye in case of large code files.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I guess that reviewing older versions of one's work can make them see where bad patterns are
    and where the good ones are and hence maybe abstract some sort of a good practice out of it,
    with things to do and things to avoid.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    One pro is that it will make the commit history more logic-based rather than time-based,
    and one con is that it is extra meta-work.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because Git is responsible for dealing with code files, and it's valid in some projects to have some codes
    split in multiple files and these files would in turn have some sort of dependency,
    which might make any change in one file affect the others.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    (git log) prints out to the command line all the commit history of the project in question
    each with a unique ID, the author of the commit, the date and the name/description of the commit
    (git diff ... ...) prints out to the command line all the differences between two commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    The ability to go back to a previous state before the damage happened will give confidence when developing.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I would love start using git to control all my upcoming projects.
